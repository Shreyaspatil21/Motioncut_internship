## Python Quiz Game 🎮

This project implements an interactive quiz game using Python's tkinter library. The game consists of a series of multiple-choice questions designed to test the user's knowledge on various topics 📚. Users are prompted to enter their name, shown instructions, and then proceed to answer questions within a timed limit ⏰. The game provides immediate feedback after each question and displays the final score at the end, indicating whether the user has passed or not based on their performance ✅❌.
